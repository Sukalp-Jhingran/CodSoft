Welcome to Chat-o-fy, a chatbot application for chatting with you forever available friend.
This project leverages machine learning techniques to provide accurate and interactive responses to user queries through a user-friendly graphical interface built with Tkinter.

Features:
  1. Interactive GUI: Built with Tkinter, featuring message scrolling and user/bot differentiation.
  2. Machine Learning Backend: Uses a Naive Bayes classifier with TF-IDF vectorization for text classification.
  3. Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilizes GridSearchCV for optimizing model parameters.
  4. Dynamic User Experience: Incorporates images and customized message boxes for enhanced interaction.

Installation:
  1. Clone the Repository
  2. Install Required Libraries
  3. Download Required Images

Project Structure:
  1. Import Libraries: Import necessary libraries for building the GUI and handling machine learning tasks.
  2. Load and Preprocess Data: Load data from a CSV file and preprocess it by removing any missing values.
  3. Train the Model: Define a pipeline for text classification using TF-IDF and Naive Bayes, and perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.
  4. Chat Functionality: Handle user interactions and generate responses from the trained model.
  5. Start the Chat Interface: Initialize the main chat window with Tkinter and configure the GUI elements.

How It Works:
  1.Data Loading and Preprocessing:
      -> Load conversation data from a CSV file.
      -> Ensure the dataset contains the necessary columns ('question' and 'answer').
      -> Remove rows with missing values.

  2. Model Training:
      -> Define a machine learning pipeline using TF-IDF vectorization and a Naive Bayes classifier.
      -> Use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the model.
      -> Train the model on the training dataset and evaluate its performance.

  3. Chatbot Functionality:
      -> Create functions to handle user messages and generate bot responses.
      -> Set up the Tkinter GUI, including text boxes for user input and chat history, and buttons for sending messages.
      -> Load and display images for user and bot messages.
      -> Start the chat interface and provide an initial greeting message from Chat-o-fy.
