Bank Customer Churn Prediction:
  This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting bank customer churn using three machine learning models: 
     -> Logistic Regression
     -> RandomForestClassifier
     -> GradientBoostingClassifier.

Project Overview:
    -> Customer churn prediction is crucial for banks to retain their customers and improve their services. 
    -> This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict whether a customer will leave the bank.

Dataset:
    -> The dataset used in this project is Churn_Modelling.csv. 
    -> It contains information about bank customers, including their demographics, account information, and churn status.

Features:
    -> CreditScore: Credit score of the customer
    -> Geography: Country of the customer
    -> Gender: Gender of the customer
    -> Age: Age of the customer
    -> Tenure: Number of years the customer has been with the bank
    -> Balance: Account balance
    -> NumOfProducts: Number of bank products the customer is using
    -> HasCrCard: Whether the customer has a credit card
    -> IsActiveMember: Whether the customer is an active member
    -> EstimatedSalary: Estimated salary of the customer
    -> Exited: Whether the customer has left the bank

Libraries Used: 
    -> numpy
    -> pandas
    -> matplotlib
    -> seaborn
    -> scikit-learn

Models: 
  Three models are used in this project:
    1. Logistic Regression
    2. RandomForestClassifier
    3. GradientBoostingClassifier


Evaluation Metrics:
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
    ->  Accuracy
    ->  Classification Report
    ->  Confusion Matrix

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to use machine learning models to predict customer churn in the banking sector. 
By identifying customers who are likely to leave, banks can take proactive measures to retain them and improve customer satisfaction.
