Spam SMS Classification:
- This project was developed as part of my AI Internship at CodSoft. 
- The goal of this project is to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam) using machine learning algorithms. 
- The project focuses on implementing and evaluating two popular algorithms: Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression.

Features:
  -> Text preprocessing using NLTK
  -> Feature extraction using TF-IDF
  -> Implementation of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression algorithms
  -> Model evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrices

Basic Codes Explanation:
  -> Data Preprocessing: Loading the dataset, cleaning the text data, and converting it to lowercase.
  -> Text Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words (tokens) using NLTK.
  -> Feature Extraction: Converting the text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
  -> Model Training: Training Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models on the extracted features.
  -> Model Evaluation: Evaluating the models' performance using accuracy scores and confusion matrices.

Imported Libraries:
  -> Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  -> NumPy: For numerical operations.
  -> NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing and tokenization.
  -> Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
        -> CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer for feature extraction.
        -> train_test_split for splitting the dataset.
        -> MultinomialNB for Naive Bayes classification.
        -> LogisticRegression for logistic regression classification.
        -> confusion_matrix and accuracy_score for model evaluation.

Results:
- The project successfully classifies SMS messages with a high level of accuracy. 
- The Naive Bayes model, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in text classification, performs well in distinguishing between spam and ham messages. 
- Logistic Regression, a widely-used algorithm for binary classification tasks, also provides robust performance with good accuracy. 
- The confusion matrices and accuracy scores for both models are provided in the notebook.
