Text Classification Project:
  This project aims to classify movie descriptions into their respective genres using machine learning models. 
  The models used in this project are Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, with a focus on preprocessing text data and evaluating model performance.

Dataset:
  The datasets used in this project are:
      -> train_data.txt: Contains training data with columns TITLE, GENRE, and DESCRIPTION.
      -> test_data.txt: Contains testing data with columns ID, TITLE, and DESCRIPTION.

Usage:
  1. Load and Explore Data:
      -> Load the training and testing datasets.
      -> Check the information and structure of the datasets.

  2. Data Visualization:
      -> Visualize the distribution of genres in the training dataset using a count plot with a custom color palette.

  3. Data Cleaning:
      -> Convert text to lowercase.
      -> Remove URLs, mentions, and special characters.
      -> Tokenize text and remove stopwords.
      -> Apply stemming using the Lancaster Stemmer.

  4. Feature Extraction:
      -> Use TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.

  5. Model Training and Evaluation:
      -> Split the training data into training and validation sets.
      -> Train and evaluate Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models.
      -> Compare the models based on validation accuracy.

  6. Prediction:
      -> Use the best-performing model to predict genres for the test dataset.

Results:
  The results of the model comparison are displayed in a bar plot, showing the accuracy of Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression models. 
  The test dataset is also displayed with the predicted genres.
